## Welcome

Welcome to the Municipal Court Manager 2.0!

It is our goal at the Municipal Software Group, LCC to provide you with high-quality, user-friendly, time-saving municipal court software.

This software application has taken years to produce. Its design is the result of over a decade of feedback from Alabama Court Clerks and Magistrates.

The Municipal Court Manager 2.0 is not perfect. It will continue to adapt, improve and change to meet your court needs. It is our goal to strive for perfection but settle for excellence.  Please continue to provide the feedback we need!

Use this manual as a reference, but don't hesitate to call our help desk 800 number.  This documentation, like the software, should continue to adapt and improve.

Happy Case Management!
