This section's focus is on converting the Charges coming from both 'Cases' and 'Warrants'. The old charges may have different spellings, statute numbers and ordinance numbers. All combinations of charges and numbers need to be converted to the new charges and numbers. Before mapping the old to the new we need to firmly establish what the new Charges are to be. This should be completed in the 'Startup Charges' Table under the Conversion Menu. Each time the conversion routines are run, 'Startup Charges' is copied into the regular 'Charges' table. For this reason, no changes should be made to the regular 'Charges' table until after the final conversion. Instead 'Startup Charges' should be set to exactly the charges to which you want to convert. Startup Charges The 'Charge' field is used to identify this charge and must be unique. It is a DROP DOWN from the 'State Charges' Table. You do not, however, have to use the State Charge wording. Unlike most DROP DOWN fields you may type what you want in this field without an error. If this is a State Charge, you should use the 'Charge Code' from that charge even if you don't use the wording. Normally the 'Charge Code' field and the 'State Charge Code' will be the same. The Statute would come from the appropriate title (32, 13A, etc) with the appropriate paragraph if needed. If this is a local charge (not state) the ordinance number should be placed in the'Local Ordinance' field. If this is a state statute, your adopting ordinance number should be placed in 'Local Ordinance'. A local charge would not have a 'Charge Code', 'State Charge Code', 'Statute' or 'Paragraph'. All charges must have the 'Charge' wording and a number in 'Local Ordinance'. Unique Charge A point to repeat is that the Charge wording must be unique. Thus, if you have 4 types of DISORDERLY CONDUCT with different paragraphs you need to find some way to distinguish them from each other. For Example: It is very important that your 'Startup Charges' be accurate and decided upon before proceeding to translating the original charges. Transfer Arrest Charges After the first phase of conversion routines run, the original charges are placed in the 'Transfer Arrest Charges' table. Likewise, the charges from the original 'Warrants' are placed in the 'Transfer Warrant Charges' located in the 'Conversion Menu'. The 'Transfer Arrest Charges' will contain every DISTINCT combination of Charge, Section, Paragraph, and Type from the old data. You may have many different versions of the same charge with only subtle differences. The transfer routines need to know how to translate each combination. Notice that the difference may be in the 'Charge' field or an added 0 in the 'Section' field or a 'Paragraph'. Each one needs to be translated to a record in your 'Startup Charges' Table. This is why it is so important that 'Startup Charges' is perfected before proceeding to 'Transfer Charges'. Every record in the 'Transfer Arrest Charges' table should have an entry in the 'Translate To' field. You should only edit the 'Translate To' field and not touch the fields above from the original data. Warrant Charges In the same manner the charges from the original Warrants need to be translated to charges in the 'Startup Charges'.","title":"Data Conversion"},{"location":"data-conversion/#data-conversion","text":"","title":"Data Conversion"},{"location":"data-conversion/#charges","text":"Converting Data from an older program can be challenging.

Terminology How about a few (yawn) definitions so that you will know whats being talked about? Application The actual software running on your computer. Also referred to as an 'app' or 'program'. The icon you click on your screen 'launches' or starts running the application on your computer. SQL The type of database used to store all your records. SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is often referred to as 'Sequel'. The data is stored on a SQL Server (either on your computer if it is not on a network or on a Network Server). On many of the report screens you will see the SQL language. It often starts with 'SELECT * FROM...' FOCUS It is the point on the screen that currently has the attention of the computer. If a data entry field has the focus, typing on the keyboard will put the characters in that field. If a screen or data entry field has the focus, it signified in some way (Color Red or Blue) so that you, the user, knows where you are on the screen. TOOL BAR A long, horizontal bar near the top of the Main Screen that contains icons that may be clicked on to perform certain tasks. TOOL TIPS Small help words that appear when placing (not clicking) the mouse over certain Data Fields or icons. Used to help identify the name of the the icon or data field and its intended use. STATUS BAR the horizontal bar across the bottom of the screen that simply informs the status of certain items such as the current Table Name, Number of Records in the Table, Current Date, etc. INFORMATION LINE the horizontal line across the bottom that provides certain information about what is happening. If the line turns red, an error has occurred. The idea is to be less intrusive with the errors and information so that you don't have to take the extra step of clicking on an error box every time. CURSOR the flashing line or box that shows exactly where you are typing. BROWSE MODE You are just looking at Data. The focus is not on the data part of the screen. You are not adding or editing data. EDIT MODE Changing data on a record that was previously created. If you ESC (or abort) while in this mode, the record will go back to its original data. ADD MODE Creating a record that was not previously there. ESC will abort the new record and it will not be saved. Field Types Fields are used to display or receive data. The kind of data received and the error checking that goes on depends on the type of field. While check boxes, buttons, etc. are not technically fields, they also are included here. FREE FORM FIELD a data field in which anything may be typed. There is no error checking. DATE FIELD A field that must either be blank or contain a valid Date. Dates may be entered either with Year First dashes (2008-01-01) or Month/Day/Year slashes (1/1/2008 or 1/1/08). If the year is omitted, the current year is assumed. \"2/25\" would produce \"02/25/2008\". Likewise, if both the month and the year are omitted, the current month and year are used to format. \"5\" would produce \"2/5/2008\". Just the letter 'T' placed in the date field will put in Today's date. becomes DROP DOWN FIELD A field that is attached to a lookup table and has a down arrow button to the right. Anything entered in this field must be in the corresponding look up table or an error is generated. You may view the drop down list by clicking on the down arrow box or by pressing the F4 key.

Clicking on the right arrow or typing Ctrl-B will allow you to open up the Lookup Table for Browsing or possible Editing. NAME DROP DOWN FIELD A Special Drop Down Field whose lookup is the Profile Table. Pressing F4 (or clicking down arrow) will display the Current Names in the Profile. As you start typing the display will change to that part of the Profile. You may at any point select a name. By simply typing in a 7 digit AL Drivers License Number or a state code and DL Number (TX17034568), a search will be launched to locate that Profile. If no Profile is found, you may do a right click to select 'Create New Profile' or type CTRL-N to start the process of creating a new Profile. CHARGE DROP DOWN FIELD A Special Drop Down Field whose lookup is the Charge Table. F4 will display a list a charges from which to select. You may also put in the DPS number to select the charge. (1 is Speeding, 2 Reckless Driving, etc.) becomes Typing in Statute (i.e. 13A-11-10) will also convert to the appropriate charge. Typing in the first few letters of a charge (enough to be unique) will also find and select the Charge. ME will become MENACING CHECK BOX True or False. If checked (by mouse clicking or hitting space bar) the item is considered to be true. BUTTON A box to click on to press to initiate some action.
